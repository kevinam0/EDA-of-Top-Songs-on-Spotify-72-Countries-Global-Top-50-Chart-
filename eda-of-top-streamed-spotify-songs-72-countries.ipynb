By identifying trends of Spotify listeners all over the world, we will discover the ways we can be both similar and unique when it comes to our taste, preferences and overall culture concerning music. Over the course of this analysis, I dived deep into many musical rabbit holes, discovering sonics and rhythms associated with particular regions that were completely new to me and I encourage you to do the same!

This dataset contains many variables, both categorical and continuous, each providing further context and detail to a top streamed song and its relative chart position.\n\nDaily ranking and daily movement would be interesting to study. From this variable we can track chart performance over time (using the snapshot_date variable) and gain understanding into the popularity and staying power of top songs. Tied to song popularity, we can analyze top streamed artists by tallying counts of their appearances (observations) on the charts. The raw data currently lists all credited artists in one variable but we can perform some data transformation to split the artists into seperate variables for an easier analysis. \n\nTurning our attention to the make-up of a top song, there are various provided measures and attributes that give description and categorization from a musicality perspective. Variables such as danceability, energy and valence would be interesting to work with to see what the commonalities/differences of a top song are from various scopes. \n\nSpeaking of scope, the data spans across 72 individual top 50 country charts. Aggregating our analysis by geography would give insight into how the world streams music at a regional and global level. We could investigate the similarites or unique differences that countries have all over the world. In addition to the top 50 charts from the 72 countries, this datasest also contains data from Spotify's Global Top 50 chart. We can seperate these observations to perform a second analysis, focusing on streaming data of the most popular global songs. \n\nData Limitations:\n\n- no country origin of song or artist, would be interesting to know where the music was created\n- no genre(s) listed as a song attribute, would be interesting to track genre popularity\n- no metric of total streams associated with song\n\nNow that we have some ideas on the scope and context of our analysis, let's perform the necessary cleaning and wrangling steps on our data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#  DATA CLEANING AND WRANGLING\n\nCheck for and remove duplicate observations.
